# Decision Curve Analysis

This is the repository for the implementation of Decision Curve Analysis in MATLAB. The function in this repository evaluates the clinical value of predictive models for a binary classification problem. Decision curve analysis identifies the range of threshold probabilities in which a model is of clinical value, the magnitude of benefit, and which of several models is optimal [[1]](#1).
